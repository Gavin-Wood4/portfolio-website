# Portfolio Website

This repository contains the code for my [personal portfolio website](https://www.gavinwood.net).

This project demonstrates basic static HTML website creation and CSS styling.

# Design Inspiration

My inspirations for the theme of this site were jazz style disposable cups, indoor glow in the dark-neon mall golf from around 2009, and outer space. 

## Current Design

- **Home Section:** Brief introduction/about me and my interests in computer engineering.
- **Projects Section:** Repeatable card system enabling me to place multiple projects stacked ontop of each other with copy and paste HTML formatting and standard text entry locations.
- **Contact Section:** Soon to provide a way to get in touch with me via an email hosted using my domain [gavinwood.net](https://www.gavinwood.net).

## Future Plans

I still have work to do on this website, some of the things I intend to include on the site are:

- **Resume Section or Page:** I am undecided on whether I want a download link or link to a viewing of my resume or whether I want to have it embedded into the website to take advantage of CSS styling.
- **More Web Based Projects:** I will add my web app work and try to make apps that can be web apps, including:
    - **Basement Temperature Logger:** Web application that shows the temperature of my basement over a selected previous amount of time up to present.
- **CSS Styling Refinement:** I intend to improve the CSS styling so that the website looks more clean and professional on different aspect ratios or resolutions.
